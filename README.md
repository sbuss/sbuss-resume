* Robot used a wireless video camera to send video to MATLAB to find movement
* Robot used holonomic drive system to move in any direction without turning

Senior research project / University Scholars Program scholarship, 

* Senior project was developing a recommender system for online news aggregation sites

* Turned into a startup, connectious.com (now offline)

Industry
========

Software Developer, Counsyl, Feb 2012 - Present
-----------------------------------------------

At counsyl I am in charge of insurance processing automation. I had no prior
knowledge of the insurance industry, but within three months I had built out
our claim filing pipeline and automated handling the responses from the payers.
On the initial launch it performed a man-month of insurance processing work
in 20 minutes. We have grown by an order of magnitude this year but we have
only grown support staff by a couple heads due to my automation efforts.

I have also implemented a patient information auto-correction service which
can automatically fix roughly 85% of bad patient insurance information without
human intervention.

I just completed work on an optimal code set calculator which determines the
best set of CPT Codes to bill insurance companies for the procedures performed.
Insurance companies pay different amounts for different procedures and now we
maximize our conversion.

I'm working almost exclusively in Python at Counsyl.

Software Development Engineer 1, Amazon, July 2010 - Feb 2012
-------------------------------------------------------------

I worked on smart categories & reﬁnements, a system to display relevant
categories and product reﬁnements for a keyword search. This was a Java service
backed by a lucene database spread across roughly 60 servers, with an average
response time of about 30ms. It was called for every keyword search on
Amazon’s websites worldwide.

I wrote a system to determine if a user’s search was generic or speciﬁc, in
order to tailor which & how many categories to display. After exploring the
data for a couple weeks I discovered a relationship between click through
rates and speciﬁcity of user queries.

I internationalized the software stack. We were only running in the US when I
joined. I added multiple language support and set up our stacks in Canada,
the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and China.

Co-Founder, Connectious.com, Fall 2008 - Spring 2010
----------------------------------------------------
Connectious.com was the continuation and application of my senior research 
project from college. I created a recommender system with a mix of Python and
C. The system leveraged the mass of data users had constructed over their years
of using the internet to recommend new websites.

Co-Founder, SwampTickets.com, LLC, Summer - Fall 2006
-----------------------------------------------------
SwampTickets was created to take advantage of a new Florida law that legalized
ticket reselling. We attempted to establish ourselves as the best place to buy
and sell University of Florida Gators football tickets, but unfortunately did
not succeed. Reasons for failure include failing to adequately respond to the
needs of our target audience (which didn’t match our initial predictions), as
well as a large pre-existing market that had operated quasi-legally for years
before our entrance into the ﬁeld.
